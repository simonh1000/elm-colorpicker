# Elm ColorPicker widget

An Elm library to help you implement a colo(u)r picker tool without relying upon the presence - or [otherwise](http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color) - of a built-in browser widget.

## Example

```elm
import ColorPicker

type alias Model =
    { colorPicker : ColorPicker.State
    , colour : Color
    }

init : Model
init =
    { colorPicker = ColorPicker.empty
    , colour = Color.rgb 255 0 0
    }

type Msg
    = ColorPickerMsg ColorPicker.Msg

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update message model =
    case message of
        ColorPickerMsg msg ->
            let
                ( m, colour ) =
                    ColorPicker.update msg model.colour model.colorPicker
            in
                { model
                    | colorPicker = m
                    , colour = colour |> Maybe.withDefault model.colour
                }

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    ColorPicker.view model.colour model.colorPicker
        |> Html.map ColorPickerMsg
```
